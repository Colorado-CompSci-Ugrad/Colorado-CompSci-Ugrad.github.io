The coding environment provides the
[**JupyterLab**](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/#)
interface.  This is an improved version for the earlier **Jupyter
Notebook** inteface; the difference is that JupyterLab has a richer
interface and supports additional visualization tools. Some

The official
[**JupyterLab**](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/)
documentation has extensive tutorial videos and guides.
We've provided direct links to some of the most commonly
needed tutorials below:

* [The JupyterLab Interface](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/interface.html)
* [Working with Files](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/files.html)
* [Text Editor](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/file_editor.html)
* [Notebooks](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/notebook.html)
* [Terminals](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/terminal.html)
* [File and Output Formats (editing MarkDown, JSON, *etc*)](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/file_formats.html)

If you are editing complex programs, you may prefer to use the [Visual Studio Code](/coding_environment_vs_code.html) extension.

In addition, we have a tutorial video showing the basic JupyterLab
functions in our coding environment.
