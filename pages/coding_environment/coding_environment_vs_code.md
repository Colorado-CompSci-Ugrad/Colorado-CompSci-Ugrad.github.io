[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is an open-source
IDE developed by Microsoft.  That IDE is available for Windows, Linux
and Mac. [Another company](https://coder.com/) has [extended
VSCode](https://github.com/codercom/code-server) to be able to run
directly in a browser. We use that version of VScode to provide
a web-based IDE in order to provide a consistent environment whether
you are using your laptop or the web coding environment.
