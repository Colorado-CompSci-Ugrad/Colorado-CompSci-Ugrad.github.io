## Cannot Save
Each student is granted a 2 GB disk to use for storage. If you exceed this amount, you will be unable to save any additional information. You can remove things you no longer need to free up space. There is also a known issue with VSCode that can cause a cache to fill the disk. You can reclaim this space by running the following command in the terminal.
```
rm -rf ~/.vscode/ipch
```
