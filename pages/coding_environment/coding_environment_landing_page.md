## Overview

The CU CS Coding Environment is a cloud based service for students taking Computer Science classes that provides a collection of tools used in our program. There is an Integrated Development Environment (Visual Studio Code), JupyterLab, Diagram, and a Terminal console. This allows students to focus on fundamentals of the classes without struggling with hardware and software configurations.
