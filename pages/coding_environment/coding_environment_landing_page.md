## Overview

The CU CS Coding Environment is a cloud based service for students taking Computer Science classes that provides a collection of tools used in our program. There is an Integrated Development Environment (Visual Studio Code), JupyterLab, Text Editor, Diagram, and a Terminal console. This allows students to focus on fundamentals of the classes without struggling with hardware and software configurations.

## Persistent Disk

Each user of the system is assigned a 2 GigaByte (GB) disk that is will be retained between sessions. Be aware that it is your responsibility to backup the data.

## Python Libraries

If you need a library that is not available in the Conding Environment, you can install them on your persistent disk.

```
pip install --user [libraryName]
```

## Login
