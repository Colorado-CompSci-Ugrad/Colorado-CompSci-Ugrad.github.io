## Obtaining a license key for VMware

Please send an email to [help@cs.colorado.edu](mailto:help@cs.colorado.edu?subject=VMware license rquest) and include you IdentiKey username. Once the registration is complete, you will receive an  email from "University of Colorado - Department of Computer Science" with the subject line "An account has been created for you". Follow the instructions in this email to complete your registration. Once you are registered and logged in, you can access the software downloads page.

To return to this store in the future, retain a copy of either the registration email or the subsequent account confirmation email and use the link inside to access the webstore. If you see an error message about already being registered or that there are no products to display, click the sign in link near the top right of the page and log in with your identikey@colorado.edu email address and the password you set when you registered the account on the webstore.

Returning Students: You can access the webstore through the link in your email from last semester and log in with the same account details. If you already have VMware Workstation or VMware Fusion installed and running on your PC, then you do not need to update and can simply install the new version of our VM into your existing VMware installation.

## Install VMware

### Windows/Linux

If you are running a Windows or Linux operating system, click on the icon for VMware Workstation and follow the instructions to add to cart, checkout, and download the software (you will not be charged for this). You will receive a serial number that you will need to copy into the program the first time you run it. Within the program itself, this code is referred to as a license key.

### Mac OS

If you are running a Mac operating system, click on the icon for VMware Fusion and follow the instructions to add to cart checkout, and download the software. Make note of your serial number as you will need to provide it once you are running the program.
