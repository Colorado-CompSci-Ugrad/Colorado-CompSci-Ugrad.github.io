Outside of class, modern work practices make extensive use of virtual machines and can also use these tools for your own projects and learning." %}

## Obtaining a license key for VMware

If you are current, active computer science student, faculty member or staff member, VMWare is provided free.

To begin the process, simply visit the [Computer Science OnTheHub Portal](https://e5.onthehub.com/WebStore/ProductsByMajorVersionList.aspx?ws=2eca00fe-8050-e711-80f0-000d3af41938&vsro=8) and sign in with your IdentiKey credentials.

If you are eligible, you will automatically be registered and verified for one year from your sign-in date.

If you do not see any products, your account does not have the egilibility requirements for automated CS portal access registration.

* Current Computer Science Career Track (Graduate, Major, Minor)
* Current Computer Science Faculty
* Current Computer Science Staff

If you are a student from a different department who wants access, please email helpcs@colorado.edu to get access assigned manually after you have logged in at least once.

## Install VMware

### Windows/Linux

If you are running a Windows or Linux operating system, click on the icon for VMware Workstation and follow the instructions to add to cart, checkout, and download the software (you will not be charged for this). You will receive a serial number that you will need to copy into the program the first time you run it. Within the program itself, this code is referred to as a license key.

### Mac OS

If you are running a Mac operating system, click on the icon for VMware Fusion and follow the instructions to add to cart checkout, and download the software. Make note of your serial number as you will need to provide it once you are running the program.
