Google has a series of resources for educators that want to use their
cloud environment in classes. Typically, this includes:

* Per-student credits
* Automated training using QwikLabs

There is a "Google Cloud Faculty" googlegroup that includes a mailing
list monitored by Google employees. You'll typically be asked to join
if you get educational credits.

## Per-Student Credits

You can [apply for course and students
credits](https://edu.google.com/programs/credits/?modal_active=none).
You need to estimate the number of students in your class.
You'll receive a link to which you can direct students -- they then
login with their `@colorado.edu` account and receive $100 in credits.
These credits **do not require a credit card** and thus can be safer
for students who have less experience in using cloud resources than
*e.g.* Amazon's student credits.

## Automated Training

[QwikLabs](https://www.qwiklabs.com/?locale=en)
are a series of training lessons that prepare students and faculty to
use Google Cloud resources.

There is an extensive [catalog of lessons for Google Cloud products,
including Hadoop, BigQuery, Spark, Kubernetes and various ML
resources](https://www.qwiklabs.com/catalog?keywords=&cloud%5B%5D=GCP&format%5B%5D=any&level%5B%5D=any&duration). Individual
lessons are grouped into "quests" -- for example the [Baseline: Data, ML, AI](https://www.qwiklabs.com/quests/34) quest combines lessons on using CloudML, Hadoop / Spark, Cloud NLP API's and more.

Many of the individual lessons are free, but some of the lessons
require "credits". [Faculty can apply for
credits](https://edu.google.com/programs/credits/training/?modal_active=none)
that can be distributed to their courses and individual students (and
IT admins) can apply for credits independent of individual
courses. The credits do not require credit card billing.

Up to May 2019, you had to separately apply for credits and training
credits; those processes will be merged [and you can apply for both
using the "beta"
program](https://edu.google.com/programs/credits/training/?modal_active=none). This
also includes access to 13 on-line Coursera courses that cover aspects
of using Google infrastructure.
