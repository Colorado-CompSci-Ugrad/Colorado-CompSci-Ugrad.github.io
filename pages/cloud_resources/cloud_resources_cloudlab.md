## Introduction

CloudLab is a testbed designed to allow researchers to experiment with cloud architectures and the new applications that they enable. This means that it is ideally suited to experiments that cannot be run in traditional clouds because they require control and/or visibility over parts of the system that would be “givens” in other clouds, such as the virtualization, storage, or network layers. See our AUP for more details.
