## Introduction

If you wish to contribute or update the documentation at this site, there are three processes you can follow:

### Directly edit the site
If you have permission to edit the site, you should be able to click the "edit me" buttons you see throughout the site.

### File a pull request
If you don't have permission, you can [clone the site](https://github.com/Colorado-CompSci-Ugrad/Colorado-CompSci-Ugrad.github.io), make your changes and then [file a pull request for the original site](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork).

### Ask someone to do it for you
Alternatively, you can [submit a request](https://github.com/Colorado-CompSci-Ugrad/Colorado-CompSci-Ugrad.github.io/issues) and provide your suggested changes.

### Leave a comment
We've enabled [Disqus.com](https://disqus.com/) comments, but we have limited staff to pay attention to the comments -- our suggestion is to use the comments to quickly highlight an issue and then
[submit a request](https://github.com/Colorado-CompSci-Ugrad/Colorado-CompSci-Ugrad.github.io/issues)
once folks and arrived at a consensus on a requested change.

## Authoring in the site

This FAQ uses the [documentation jekyll theme](https://idratherbewriting.com/documentation-theme-jekyll/) and documentation
for that theme is included at the theme site.
