## Introduction

GitHub Enterprise will allows the integration with identity management and the ability to have programmatic / API control of repositories. For example, imagine you have a class of 600 students in which you would like to have each student clone a repo with assignment details and then use a continuous integration (CI) system to update grades based on test completions. Much of this can and is done using the single-class Github-for-Education system, but it is more difficult to automate than desired and offers no efficiency of scale.
