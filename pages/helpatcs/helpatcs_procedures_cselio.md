## Introduction

The CS Department has leased the csel.io domain and uses it for internal testing and development. Below you will find various information about administrative setup.


## Registrar

The domain is registered with [gandi.net](https://v4.Gandi.net). There is currently an issue with our account in that it is not being automatically migrated to their new v5 website. The link above will take you to the old v4 interface where you can login to our account using the credentials provided in the CS password vault.

## DNS Management

The management of DNS hostnames is provided by [CloudFlare](https://dash.cloudflare.com/login). Login using the credentials from the CS password vault and you will be able to manage the hostname and IP address mappings.
