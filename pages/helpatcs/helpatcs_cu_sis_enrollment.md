## Introduction

Faculty and staff need a reliable interface to enrollment information to provide a data feed to support systems. Current processes require faculty members to pull class rosters for each of their classes at a regular interval until after the drop deadline each semester. This project would automate the pulling of this information from CU-SIS and feed it to dependent systems.
