## Introduction

The CS Department has a site license for VMware that allows us to grant short term licenses to students. This license is particularly valuable to students taking Operating System and other classes where the Coding Environment cannot provide the services needed (big memory, high CPU, kernel hacking, etc). Below you will find information about the common activities needed to manage the VMware subscriptions.

## Logging in

The login page and licensing service is hosted at [OnTheHub VMware e5 Administration](https://e5.onthehub.com/Admin/Security/Signin.aspx?rurl=%2fAdmin%2fUsers%2fUserList.aspx). You will need the Account Number, Username and Password from the staff password vault.

## Search for User(s)

1. Start by clicking on the Users link in the left side navigation.
