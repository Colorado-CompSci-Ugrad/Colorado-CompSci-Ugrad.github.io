## Introduction

Runestone eBooks offer rich content to ask questions such as a programming task, multiple choice question, or watch a video. We self-host our Runestone ebooks which are run on the Runestone eBook server. There are many eBooks available to use right away, or you can create/modify your own eBook version. For example, a modified version of "How to Think Like a Computer Scientist" could be tailored to meet your specific course needs.
